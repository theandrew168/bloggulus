## Setup
This project depends on the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/dl/) and the [TailwindCSS CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).

## Database
This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for persistent storage.
To develop locally, you'll an instance of the database running somehow or another.
I find [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be a nice tool for this but you can do whatever works best.

The following command starts the necessary containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

These containers can be stopped via:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Running
If actively working on frontend templates, set `ENV=dev` to tell the server to reload templates from the filesystem on every page load.
Run the web server (in a background process) and let Tailwind watch for CSS changes:
```bash
# make run
ENV=dev go run main.go &
tailwindcss --watch -m -i tailwind.input.css -o static/css/tailwind.min.css
```

## Testing
Tests can be ran after starting the necessary containers and applying database migrations:
```bash
# make test
go run main.go -migrate
go test -v ./...
```

Note that the tests will leave random test in the database so feel free to flush it out by restarting the containers:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
